# Full-Stack Expense Tracker

Simple expense tracker.

## How to use

Run the command `npm install`

Once that is complete, run `npm run dev` for concurrently to launch the front and backend.

The config.env will need to contain 3 items:

<ul>
<li>NODE_ENV</li> 
<li>PORT</li>
<li>MONGO_URI</li> 
</ul>

Fill those in with the correct values for your application.
